# Challenge 3: Sustainable Pest Control

### Problem Statement

In the arid and semi-arid regions of Kenya, pest infestations significantly threaten crop yields and food production. Traditional pest control methods, often involving harmful chemicals, can harm the environment and beneficial insects. How can we develop sustainable and eco-friendly pest control strategies that are tailored to these unique environmental conditions?

### Challenge Description

This challenge encourages participants to design sustainable pest control solutions that minimize environmental harm and protect beneficial insects, with a specific focus on the arid and semi-arid areas of Kenya. Solutions can include developing alternative pest control methods such as biopesticides, integrated pest management, or precision agriculture that suit the local ecosystem and conditions. Your solution should be practical, cost-effective, and ecologically friendly.

### Expected Outcome

Participants are expected to create innovative pest control strategies that are tailored to the arid and semi-arid regions of Kenya. Successful solutions should reduce the use of harmful pesticides, promote ecological balance, and enhance crop protection within the specific environmental constraints of these regions. By the end of this challenge, we aim to have prototypes or strategies that can be implemented by farmers to improve pest control practices in these areas.
