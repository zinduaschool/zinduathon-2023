# Challenge 2: Crop Disease Detection
### Problem Statement

In the arid and semi-arid regions of Kenya, crop diseases pose a severe threat to agricultural productivity, food security, and the livelihoods of local farmers. Timely and accurate detection of crop diseases is critical to prevent their spread and minimize crop damage. How can technology and data-driven solutions be harnessed to identify and manage crop diseases effectively in these challenging environments?

### Challenge Description

We invite participants to create innovative solutions for detecting and managing crop diseases specifically designed for arid and semi-arid regions in Kenya. Your solutions should leverage technology, including machine learning, image recognition, and data analytics, to provide early warnings of potential crop diseases. These solutions should be tailored to the unique agricultural conditions and crops found in these regions, enabling farmers to take preventive measures to protect their livelihoods.

### Expected Outcome

By the end of this challenge, we aim to have functional prototypes or tools that can identify and monitor crop diseases with a high degree of accuracy in Kenya's arid and semi-arid regions. Successful solutions will be accessible to local farmers and experts, contributing to improved crop management, reduced crop losses, and enhanced food security in these challenging environments.
