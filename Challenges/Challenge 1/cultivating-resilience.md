## **Challenge 1: Cultivating Resilience and Increasing Yields**

### **Problem Statement**

In arid and semi-arid regions, traditional farming encounters significant challenges due to water scarcity and unpredictable weather conditions. Farmers in these areas struggle to achieve reliable yields for their livelihoods. We are seeking innovative solutions that merge agriculture and technology to enhance the resilience and productivity of farming in drylands.

### **Challenge Description**

We invite participants to devise creative solutions that harness technology and coding to tackle the issues faced by farmers in arid and semi-arid lands. This may involve designing efficient irrigation systems, weather prediction tools, soil health monitoring, or any other technology-driven approach that enhances agricultural practices in these demanding environments.

### **Expected Outcome**

At the conclusion of this Hackathon, our objective is to have innovative prototypes or solutions that can significantly enhance farming practices in arid and semi-arid lands. These solutions should be practical, sustainable, and accessible to local farmers, ultimately leading to increased food security and economic prosperity in these regions.
